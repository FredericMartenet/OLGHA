# Overlapping Generations Heterogeneous Agents (OLGHA) Model

This repository contains routines that solves an overlapping generations heterogenous agents model. This model is inspired by the seminal work of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987) with a precise demographic structure and incomplete markets as in Huggett (1996). 

The notebook [OLGHA.ipynb](OLGHA.ipynb) solves the model and explains the details. The classes and functions are stored in the folder `model`.
